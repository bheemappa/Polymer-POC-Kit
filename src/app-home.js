        Polymer is a library created by Google that enables us to build cross-browser compatible apps and elements with web components
        </p>
        <div class="circle">2</div>
        <p>
         It provides syntactic sugar to native web components as well as polyfills for browsers that don't support web components yet. Shadow DOM is difficult and costly to polyfill, so Polymer provides a separate shady DOM polyfill to implement the features of shadow DOM in browsers that lack support.
